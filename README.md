# COVID19-Survey-Form
The task to create a for regarding covid 19 survey Where admin can add and see question's responses and user can just submit or fill a form 

Facing problem in integrating firebase with the project because of version change in firebase in version 8 it supports namespaced structure but now in version 9 modular approach is introduced.
created an admin user in firebase, need to store questions in realtime database named as firestore so we can get questions dynamically...
